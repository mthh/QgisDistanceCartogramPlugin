about=DistanceCartogram QGIS plugin allows you to create distance cartogram. This is done by extending (by interpolation) to the layer(s) of the study area (territorial divisions, network...) the local displacement between the source coordinates and the image coordinates, derived from the distances between each pair of homologous points (source / image points). DistanceCartogram allows to create distance cartograms in two ways: from two layers of homologous points (source points and image points) or from a layer of points and a durations matrix between them.
